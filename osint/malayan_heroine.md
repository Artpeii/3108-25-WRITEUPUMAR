So I ask my intelligent and generous friend, DeepSeek :) <br>

So we know the heroine's name is Sybil Kathigasu, and her daughter's name is Olga Kathigasu. <br> 
But since the answer 3108{olga_kathigasu} doesn't work, we should fact-check with Wikipedia. <br>

It seems that she has another daughter named Dawn Kathigasu. <br>
Flag: 3108{dawn_kathigasu}
