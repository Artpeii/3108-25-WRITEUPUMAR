## Lesson Learned
- Always check the cookies and JS, especially for Web CTF
- I do need to learn more about forensic, cryptography and reverse engineering basics as I can't yet solve any of those challenges.
- Need to learn using Linux, Docker and many other tools. Thankfully, 100 points OSINT and Web questions are tech-newbie-friendly.
- Use less of using AI and refer to past CTF writeups to really improve hacking skills.
